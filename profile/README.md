# PorkyProductions

## Powerful, Cross-Platform, Open Source


Since our inception, those words have guided us to create apps that everyone will love. This organization is not only dedicated to the apps that it holds, but also to the developers that made them possible, because without our developers, this would not be possible.

# General Info

## About PorkyProductions
Porky Productions is a group of highly established individuals, namely Tristan and Ryan, who are on the path for technological development in many areas.

## Our Mission

We believe that technology can be used to create a better world, and that we can use technology to help us do that. Join us as we create technology that can change the world! 

## A Bit of History
Our story begins in 2017, when our founders, Tristan and Ryan met in school. They became friends and eventually discorvered that they could make a website using the `Google Sites` service. What better thing to make a website about than a hedgehog pencil sharpener that Tristan had brought to school and named "Porky". After this website (PorkyPictures.inc) was created, many other websites followed such as PorkySchool.edu, PorkyPizza.eat, and `PorkyBlackHolesThatWillDestroyTheEntireUniverse-
SoYouProbablyShouldntUseThem.com.com.inc`

At this point, Porky had developed a cult following. But then, sadly, a hater of porky stole the pencil sharpener, and destroyed it. However, at the last moment, Porky transferred into a Hedgehog plush, where it resides to this day. Later on, the old websites were archived, and consolidated into one company, called PorkyProductions, which is where we are today.
